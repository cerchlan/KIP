					<h4 class="subtitle">Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind by Noah Yuval Harari</h4>
					<h5>Both Melinda and I read this one, and it has sparked lots of great conversations at our dinner table. Harari takes on a daunting challenge: to tell the entire history of the human race in just 400 pages. He also writes about our species today and how artificial intelligence, genetic engineering, and other technologies will change us in the future. Although I found things to disagree with - especially Harari's claim that humans were better off before we started farming - I would recommend Sapiens to anyone who's interested in the history and future of our species.</h5>

					<h5>A novelist explains her philosophy of life through a series of loosely connected personal observations. Quindlen's fictional works center around women's roles and how they see themselves, so women will find her encouragement and advice about thses topics particularly apt.The core of this book was a commencement address that Quindlen didn't deliver due to planned protests from anti-abortion activists.</h5>
